Feature: [Console_02_03] Create APP API

  Background:
   Given an user exists
     And an existing certificate and RSA key

  Scenario: [Console_02_03_01]
    Create app successfully with create_db = 1

   Given Dynamo_DB will successfully create table
    When client send a POST request to /v1/oauth2/applications with:
